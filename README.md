# Blog  Web App

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application. Styling will be an important aspect of this project to ensure a good user experience.

## Features
1. Post Creation: Users are able to create new posts.

2. Post Viewing: The home page allows the user to view all their posts.

3. Post Update/Delete: Users can edit and delete posts as needed.

4. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive using Bootstrap, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
